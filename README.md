ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Assignment 2 of course CS3263 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence! 

# Guideline

- Please complete this Assignment in a **TWO-person team**.
- **ONE person from each team** will need to submit **ALL** the answers.
- Grading will be done team-wise. Please register your groups on Canvas.
- The deadline for the assignment is **`12 April 2024, 2359`**.

You are encouraged to discuss solution ideas. However, each team *must write up the solutions independently*. It is considered plagiarism if the solution write-up is highly similar to other teams' write-ups or other sources.


# Submission

- Complete the codes in `main.ipynb` and **copy** your solutions to `programming.py`.
- Please write the following on the top of your solution files:
    - The **name(s)** and **metric number(s)** of ALL team members as they appear on Canvas.
    - Collaborators (write *None* if no collaborators).
    - Sources, if any, or if you obtained the solutions through research, e.g., through the web.
- Your programming part should be zipped and named `netid1-netid2.zip`. **Only submit the zipped file to Canvas**.
- **IMPORTANT:** The programming part will be auto-graded on the [CodePost](https://codepost.io/) platform.
    - You don't need to submit the code to CodePost. We will import your submissions from Canvas.
    - Note that the `programming.py` file is designed for auto-grading, so you cannot run it normally from your end but don't worry.
    - DO NOT modify any code outside the blocks you're allowed to; DO NOT print any message in `programming.py`.

- Your submission should zipped and named `netid1-netid2.zip`, where the `netid` is the id starting with `exxx`.
- The folder structure should be strictly formed as follows:
    ```
    netid1-netid2.zip
        |â”€â”€ minihouse
        |â”€â”€ Assignment2.ipynb
        â””â”€â”€ programming.py
    ```
